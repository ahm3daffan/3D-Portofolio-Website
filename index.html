          I'm good boy who eats and shits whenever I urge to. I intend to make people my puppet so they can listen to me. I try to make other people laugh so that I can feel declining screaming of inner demons

          ngl I'm literally one step away from making this my onlyfans account where I can post pics of girls who 9+. I'm making this website to myself feel that I know WT and I feel proud about it but in turn I feel the very peak of learning as deep trench of unknowing technology which I'm not ready to submerge in. Hope I find a good girl and have alot of good sesc with her so that I feel good. Hope I find new start up and become rich so that I'm not

        <p>
        <strong>The Big Mart Sales Predtiction(Data Science)</strong>  
        </p>
        <p>
          Worked on refining data sets, analyzing the data using NumPy, then manipulating the data using pandas and concluding review on the improvement of Big Mart Dataset by using PowerPoint Presentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Covid-19 Data Analysis Project using Python          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>Collecting dataset of Covid-19 attributes and splitting the data into training and testing sets using NumPy, then using Logistics Regression model from Sklearn to predict the symptoms, then using flask we make a minimal framework and finally using pickle to make data serialized and store it. To make it interactive we use Bootstrap to make a Website for predicting the probability of Covid-19 symptoms.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Drowsiness Detector(Blink Detector) OpenCV Project using Python
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on Tereza Soukupova and Jan¬¥ Cech's Real-Time Eye Blink Detection using Facial Landmarks.  We capture the video using OpenCV and dlib library then we use a hog face detector to detect the face then use the euclidean distance ratio to find if the eye is closed or not from range in (42,48) and (36,42) in the landmarks algorithm.

        </p>
        <p><strong>IMDB Movie Dataset Analysis using R
        </strong></p>
        <p>Reading the dataset and refining the dataset using NumPy and pandas then using matplotlib and seaborn to compare and plot various graphs and analyze different types </p>
        <p><strong>Face Landmark Detection Using Python</strong></p>
        <p>Based on Tereza Soukupova and Jan¬¥ Cech's Real-Time Eye Blink Detection using Facial Landmarks. We use OpenCV and dlib libraries. First, we capture the video then using the Hog face detector which is compatible with the face landmark detector then fix the range of it and detect the face.</p>
        <p><strong>3D Portfolio Website using JS
        </strong></p>
        <p>Based on Fireship.io 3D website, I took inspiration from that website and tried to make my website similar to that. I have used CSS and Three.js. Three.js is a JS library and API for 3D computer graphics in a web browser using WebGL. For starters, establish the scene, camera, and renderer for background in JS. Then define geometry, material, mesh, animation loop, and lighting.  Finally using write down the content in HTML.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Restaurant Website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
        </strong></p>
        <p>Using HTML I made the basic skeleton of Website then used CSS design and then developed overall website using JS.
